# Differenziamo

##What is it?
It's an assignment requested as a tech check on my skills.
The task was to build a web page with a waste material collection that needed to be put in the right container.

###Specifics
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.1.3.

- Install the node_modules with npm install
- Run `npm start` for a dev server.
- Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

If you run in an error like "Error: error:0308010C:digital envelope routines::unsupported" before npm start or ng serve use on terminal "set NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider"

Have fun!
